Still a work in progress

Unity WebP API
==============

+ Needs to Decode the WebP Data into an Image Structure (that can later be used to create a Texture2D)
+ Needs to support Multiple ColorSpaces for Output Data
+ Supports Scaling of Image
+ Can pass Options to Decode / Encode Request
+ Mimic native API as closely as possible
+ Generate a Header Structure 
+ Needs to support Multi-Threading

+ Useful Scale / Crop Calculation can be done in an Image Support Class
